# YOLO-v8-Custom-Object-Detection-Personal-Protective-Equipment
YOLO v8 custom object detection tutorial with two-classe custom dataset. I cover how to annotate custom dataset in YOLO format, setting up environment for YOLO v8, and train custom object detection model. Although I show a demonstration using YOLO v8 medium version, the method is generic enough to train all variations of YOLO v8.
